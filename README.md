## Working 

#### Original Image & Logo-

#### Watermarked Image & its comparision-

The white part represent that there is difference between Original image and watermarked image.
#### Dewatermarked Image & its comparision-

The all black part represent that there is no difference between Original image and watermarked image.
#### Comparision between different images-
